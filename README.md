This project implements machine learning techniques in MATLAB to detect cardiac pathologies from medical data. The system compares different classification methods and employs feature selection to optimize performance.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Three classification methods compared: k-NN, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes
- Data preprocessing including missing value removal and z-score normalization
- Feature selection using Chi-square and PCA dimensionality reduction
- Performance evaluation through loss calculation and confusion matrices
- Fall detection dataset analysis with k-means clustering

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The project uses two datasets:
1. `Heart_Pathology_Dataset.csv` - Contains cardiac pathology data with 13 features
2. `falldetection_dataset.csv` - Used for additional analysis

## ðŸ§  Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Removal of rows with missing values
- Data standardization using z-score normalization

### 2. Classification Methods
- 80/20 train-test split
- Implemented classifiers:
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
  - Decision Tree
  - Naive Bayes

### 3. Feature Reduction
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Chi-square feature selection to identify top 5 most significant features

### 4. Performance Evaluation
- Loss calculation for each model
- Confusion matrices for classification results
- Silhouette analysis for k-means clustering
